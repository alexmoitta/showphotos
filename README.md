# showphotos
Showphotos is an Android native app. It loads an image json and shows each one of them on a vertical navigation.
It was built on Android Studio 1.5. 
I think it's a good example for learning RecyclerView and Fragment. 
I used two books to learn and develop this app: 
  1) Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide . The current edition is third.
  2) The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development . https://commonsware.com/Android/
Android frontend is always changing. Therefore, I recommend always using the last edition of these books.
